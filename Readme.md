# Test Shoutbox

Place the module files within the "modules" folder of you project and install this module. Under "Content" -> "Shoutboxes" you will find the main administration page where you can create a new shoutbox. This page will list all shoutboxes you created.

## Set permissions

After installing you can define which roles have the permission to administer shoutboxes, to add new answers and to view published shoutboxes.

## Shoutboxes

For each shoutbox you can define the question, some details about the question and some administrative settings: if new answers to the question should be published immediately or just after moderation, if the whole shoutbox is published or not and if the answering is open at the moment. If the answering is closed no answering form and no answers are shown to the visitors.

## Answers on shoutboxes

On the detail page of a shoutbox users with permission to add new answers see a button which opens a form to place the answer. Depending on the settings of the shoutbox the answer will be published immediately or not. If not users with administer permission need to check the "published" checkbox on the answer edit form before the answers become visible to the public.
